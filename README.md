This project utilizes the STM32F334R8 Nucleo board and the NEO-6M V2 GPS sensor to create a comprehensive tracking system.
The microcontroller efficiently processes GPS data, providing real-time location information. 
The Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) offers an intuitive map display, enhancing user experience. 
Contributions and feedback are welcome to further enhance the functionality and usability of the system.
